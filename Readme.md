<h1>Guess the Flag </h1>

The second project of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/guess-the-flag-introduction)). This project is about a guessing game that helps users learn some of the many flags of the world.

At the end of the guided tutorial, there are some challenges that are implemented by myself (without Paul's guidance). They will be in separate commits, one for each challenge.

<b>Challenge #1</b>: Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert and in the score label.

<b>Challenge #2</b>: When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.

<b>Challenge #3</b>: Make the game show only 8 questions, at which point they see a final alert judging their score and can restart the game.

<b><h3> External challenges </h3></b>
These challenges come from different tutorials throughout the 100 days of the course.

<b> Challenge from Project 3 (technique project)</b>: Go back to project 2 and replace the Image view used for flags with a new FlagImage() view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.
