<h1>Guess the Flag </h1>

The second project of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/guess-the-flag-introduction)). This project is about a guessing game that helps users learn some of the many flags of the world.

At the end of the guided tutorial, there are some challenges that are implemented by myself (without Paul's guidance). They will be in separate commits, one for each challenge.

<b> Challenge #1 </b>: Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert and in the score label.

<b> Challenge #2 </b>: When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
